<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## What I learn
This project was a good challenge to improve my skills and challenge myself. 

üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Incorporating Next.js provided a more streamlined and efficient approach to server-side rendering and client-side navigation, resulting in a smoother and more optimized overall user experience.

‚≠ê In this project, I significantly expanded my TypeScript proficiency, allowing me to create more robust and secure code structures. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of advanced practices, such as advanced type manipulation, complex interfaces, and efficient use of TypeScript ecosystem resources.
This enabled me to develop more scalable and resilient solutions.

üé® This project will offer the opportunity to acquire skills in the effective use of Sass, aiming to create efficient styles. This will allow for remarkable scalability and a smooth transition in the face of design changes as the project evolves.

ü™ê I acquired skills in effectively using the Leaflet library to develop interactive maps. This tool offers a lightweight and flexible approach to integrating customizable maps into websites, enabling the addition of markers, informative pop-ups, vector layers, and interactive features such as zooming and dragging.
